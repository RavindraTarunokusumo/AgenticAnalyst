## Future Backlog

Candidate next slices, roughly in suggested priority order. None have a spec
yet; each needs Workflow Step 3 (spec + lightweight plan) before
implementation. See chat/session notes from 2026-07-15 for the full rationale
behind this ordering.

- [ ] **Prediction expectation resolution.** `PredictionExpectation` rows
      are created by the frontier synthesis graph (`proposed_expectations`)
      with `outcome_status`, but nothing ever revisits and updates that
      status later (no confirm/falsify job or route). The falsifiable-
      predictions concept is half-built: expectations are proposed but never
      checked against what actually happened.
- [ ] **claim_event / contradiction graph.** Explicitly deferred since the
      initial migration (`docs/database.md`); no schema, no design started.
      Likely the largest single slice on this list - needs its own spec
      before scoping, not a quick follow-on.
