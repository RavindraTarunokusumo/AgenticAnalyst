## 2026-07-11 — Technical Harness Implementation (codex/harness-20260710, PR #1)

- What worked:
  - Task-scoped commits with specific staging (never git add -A) and attached git notes.
  - Implementing *all* tasks (4-8) first, then single full quality gate run at the end (as explicitly requested) — avoided repeated expensive full pytest/mypy during dev.
  - Delegating bundled review via subagent (captured sessionId, PENDING review posted).
  - Using receiving-code-review protocol: verified each finding vs actual code before fixing, pushed back on skeleton-scope items (intentional per approved plan).
  - Python -c and PowerShell here-strings / Set-Content for reliable multi-line edits and heredocs (pwsh parsing of << EOF is fragile in tool).
  - git status before every action + full gates (ruff + mypy src + pytest) after key fixes.

- What failed:
  - Unix tools in pwsh (head, tail, grep, | cat) consistently fail or produce parser errors — must use Select-Object, Select-String, python -c.
  - Background tasks (long gates) often return "(no output yet)" in tool; had to re-run or read .log files directly from ~/.grok/sessions/.../terminal/.
  - git remote was pointing to old AnalystEngine name (repo had moved); push --dry-run revealed it, had to set-url and re-push.
  - main checkout already claimed by another worktree; had to operate on main via git -C <main-path> and absolute paths for edits.
  - Some mypy "errors" were only 3p stub notes or layout (tests/fixtures duplicate module); had to add explicit_package_bases + overrides to get clean "Success".

- Useful commands:
  - git status --porcelain; git push --dry-run origin HEAD (always first).
  - ="copy"; uv run ... (for OneDrive hardlink issues).
  - gh pr create --body-file ... --json number,url ; gh pr merge <num> --merge
  - python -c "..." for complex re.sub on TODO, archive creation.
  - uv run ruff ... --fix ; uv run mypy src ; uv run pytest --ignore=tests/evaluation

- Scripts created: pr-body.md (temp), various python one-liners for archive/TODO strip.

- Workflow improvement:
  - "Implement all then full gate" is powerful for long-running verification steps; should be documented as option when user requests it.
  - Always surface background task logs by reading the .log file path when tool says "(no output yet)".
  - For worktrees + main post-PR pushes: document the -C <main> + absolute-path pattern for edits.

- Skill worth adding or updating:
  - receiving-code-review subagent could auto-extract actionable items + suggest patches.
  - review skill could better handle "skeleton by design" cases and avoid flagging intentional placeholders.
